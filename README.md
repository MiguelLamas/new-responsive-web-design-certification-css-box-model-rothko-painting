Reviewing fundamentals of HTML and CSS via the freeCodeCamp - (New) Responsive Web Design Certification, practicing how to build webpages using HTML for content, and CSS for design.

Every HTML element is its own box â€“ with its own spacing and a border. This is called the Box Model.

I reviewed CSS, and the Box Model specifically to create Rothko-style rectangular art pieces to practice.
